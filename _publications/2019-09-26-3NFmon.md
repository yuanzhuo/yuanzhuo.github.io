We present a study of the role played by realistic three-body forces in providing a reliable monopole component of the effective shell-model Hamiltonian. To this end, starting from a nuclear potential built up within the chiral perturbation theory, we derive effective shell-model Hamiltonians with and without the contribution of the three-body potential and compare the results of shell-model calculations with a set of observables that evidence shell-evolution properties. The testing ground of our investigation is nuclei belonging to the fp shell, since the shell-evolution towards shell closures in 48Ca and 56Ni provides a paradigm for shell-model Hamiltonians. Our analysis shows that only by including contributions of the three-body force is the monopole component of the effective shell-model Hamiltonian then able to reproduce the experimental shell evolution towards and beyond the closure at N = 28.
