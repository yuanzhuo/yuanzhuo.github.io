The nuclear charge radius of 32Si was determined using collinear laser spectroscopy. The experimental result was confronted with ab initio nuclear lattice effective field theory, valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group, and mean field calculations, highlighting important achievements and challenges of modern many-body methods. The charge radius of 32Si completes the radii of the mirror pair 32Ar-32Si, whose difference was correlated to the slope L of the symmetry energy in the nuclear equation of state. Our result suggests L ≤ 60 MeV, which agrees with complementary observables.
