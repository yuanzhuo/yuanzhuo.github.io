We survey the impact of nuclear three-body forces on structure properties of nuclei within the shell model. It has long been acknowledged, since the seminal works of Zuker and coworkers, that three-body forces play a fundamental role in making the monopole component of shell-model Hamiltonians, derived from realistic nucleonnucleon potentials, able to reproduce the observed evolution of the shell structure. In the vast majority of calculations, however, their effects have been taken into account by shell-model practitioners by introducing ad hoc modifications of the monopole matrix elements. During last twenty years, a new theoretical approach, framed within the chiral perturbation theory, has progressed in developing nuclear potentials, where two- and many-body components are naturally and consistently built in. This new class of nuclear forces allows to carry out nuclear structure studies that are improving our ability to understand nuclear phenomena in a microscopic approach. We provide in this work an update on the status of the nuclear shell model based on realistic Hamiltonians that are derived from two- and three-nucleon chiral potentials, focusing on the role of the threebody component to provide the observed shell evolution and closure properties, as well as the location of driplines. To this end, we present the results of shell-model calculations and their comparison with recent experimental measurements, which enlighten the relevance of the inclusion of three-nucleon forces to master our knowledge of the physics of atomic nuclei.
