<--!Nuclear lattice effective theory (NLEFT) is an ab initio method that combines effective field theory with lattice Monte Carlo simulations. The use of unrestricted Monte Carlo simulations, together with newly developed lattice methods, allows for investigations of strong many-body correlations, ranging from light nuclei to medium-mass nuclei, and from cold neutron matter to nuclear thermodynamics. In this talk, I will briefly introduce the framework of NLEFT, several newly developed methods, and high-performance large-scale GPU programming for the Exascale supercomputer. With that, I will discuss our recent ab initio calculations of spin and density correlations in hot neutron matter, which have a large impact on neutrino heating and shock revival in core-collapse supernovae. These ab initio lattice calculations can now be used to calibrate neutrino opacity in supernovae simulations.-->
