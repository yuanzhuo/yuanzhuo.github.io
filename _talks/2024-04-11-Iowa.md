<!-- Nuclear lattice effective theory (NLEFT) is an ab initio method that combines effective field theory with lattice Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The use of unrestricted Monte Carlo simulations, together with newly developed lattice methods, allows for investigations of strong many-body correlations, ranging from light nuclei to medium-mass nuclei, and from cold neutron matter to nuclear thermodynamics. However, its capability and accuracy are constrained by Monte Carlo sign cancellations, also known as the “sign problem”. In this talk, I will discuss the origin of the “sign problem” in NLEFT, several newly developed methods to resolve this difficulty, and high-performance large-scale GPU calculations on Exascale supercomputers. After that, I would also like to introduce our recent calculations and predictions about nuclear charge radii and finite-temperature neutron matter structure factor.
