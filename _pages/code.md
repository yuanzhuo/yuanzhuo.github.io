# **MTS (Multi-Task Scheduler)**  

[**MTS**](https://github.com/yuanzhuo/MTS) is a lightweight bash-based task scheduler designed to distribute and manage multiple tasks efficiently using HPC resources (CPU/GPU) allocated through **a single Slurm job**. Inspired by [MTEAQ](https://github.com/evanberkowitz/metaq), MTS simplifies task management by leveraging a file-based system to track job status. It is **easy to set up** and can run any language code (like C++, Fortran, Python etc.) with MTS and it can also be used on local machines (e.g., laptops).
